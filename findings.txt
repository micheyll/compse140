Fndings on what containers share with the host:

- Containers share the same kernel as the host.
  This is a key difference from virtual machines, which run their own kernel.
  Can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

- Containers share the same network as the host.
  Often true, although containers can be isolated from the host network. For example, on these containers we created
  a separate network for the containers to communicate with each other.

- Containers can mount volumes from the host, allowing for data persistence and sharing between host and container.
  Often required if the contaiers are not stateless.

- Containers can access the host's resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
  Tools like 'ps' in a container can potentially see host processes, depending on the configuration.
  Can be limited through cgroups, but not fully isolated like in VMs.
