A LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) was used to help with this exercise.

The reason for my using it is that it's been quite a while since I had to write services such as these, so it made
the entry to getting back into coding much less intimidating.

The LLM helped me with the structure as well as the syntax of the code: I prompted it with a similar task, and then used
its output to guide me in writing the actual code for the assignment.

The LLM - as is usually the case - tried to make the code needlessly complicated, which required me to prompt it multiple
times, asking for simpler solutions. However, it was still a great help in getting me started.

It seems whatever dataset 3.5 Sonnet is trained on is quite knowledgeable about Ruby and Python, as it was able to provide
me with a lot of useful information on the topic. I tried writing service2 in Nim, but quickly realized that I don't have
the necessary skills (or the interest) to keep going with it, as the LLM was unable to provide any useful information on
how to write the code in that language. I'll keep Nim in mind for the future, though, as it seems like a very interesting
language to learn.
